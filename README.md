# readability_score

In this code We're predicting the reading ease of excerpts from literature. We've provided excerpts from several time periods and a wide range of reading ease scores. The test set includes a slightly larger proportion of modern texts (the type of texts we want to generalize to) than the training set.
It shows how to train a neural network model with pre-trained BERT in Tensorflow/Keras
